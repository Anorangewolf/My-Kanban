从7月28日更新flutter3起至今天凌晨2点30分，我一直因为我自己之前的某个无意间的错误配置遭到vscode中dart插件的分析器的龟速的困扰。7月30日我修改了部分电脑和vscode配置，起到了一定效果，但并没有完全解决问题。之后我多次还原电脑以短暂解决问题但依旧是治标不治本。
就在刚刚，我无意通过搜索软件在stack overflow的一个快照站上找到一个解决方案：

Use "Recommended Settings" .
Steps: Cntrl + Shift + P > Type and select "Use Recommended Settings".
This overwrites the recommended settings for Dart.

重置后一切正常了！
Happy! happy! happy! 
谢谢你Slick Slime！

Since the update of Flutter3 on July 28th until 2:30am today, I have been troubled by the slow speed of the Dart Analyzer in VSCode due to an unintentional misconfigured by myself. On July 30th, I made some modifications to my computer and VSCode configuration, which had some effect but did not completely solve the problem. Afterwards, I restored the computer multiple times to temporarily solve the problem, but it still did not treat the root cause.
Just now, I accidentally found a solution on a snapshot site of stack overflow through edge: 

**Use "Recommended Settings"**
**Steps:** Cntrl + Shift + P > Type and select "Use Recommended Settings".
*This overwrites the recommended settings for Dart.*

It is all right after resetting!
Happy! Happy! Happy! 
Thank you, Slick Slime.
